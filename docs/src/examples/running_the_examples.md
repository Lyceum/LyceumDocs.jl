# Running the Examples

All examples can be found as Julia scripts and Jupyter notebooks in a
self-contained Julia project which is available here:
[`examples.tar.gz`](https://docs.lyceum.ml/dev/static/examples.tar.gz).

Once downloaded, extract the archive with your tool of choice. On Linux machines, you can run:

```
tar xzf examples.tar.gz
```

which will produce a folder in the same directory named "LyceumExamples". Inside, you'll
find a `README.md`, reproduced below, with further instructions.
